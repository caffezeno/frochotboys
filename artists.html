      <h2>Marcelino Hooi</h2>

      <p>
        <b>Marcelino Hooi</b> is a Paris based impressionist painter. He uses light and shadows as a building blocks
        for constructing space and form in his paintings. Paintings that emphasize moments of stillness and solitude
        in everyday city life
      </p>

      <p>
        Marcelino's practices are rooted in urban observation. Watching someone smoke a
        cigarette, walking into the metro station, or crossing the street. Scenes that no one
        would really notice, but at the same time scenes that everyone would notice missing
        would they cease to exist. Marcelino’s works describe
        <u><i>the quiet</i></u> that people often miss in big cities like Paris.
        Drawing parallels with <u><i>the sublime</i></u> as we know from romanticism.
        As if his works are telling the viewer that the quiet is still there,
        for those who notice.
      </p>

      <p>
        A key work presented within this context is
        <i>Smoking in front of Dirty Dick</i> (2026), one of his most recent paintings.
        The painting depicts three characters. Two of them smoking in front of a bar,
        closed during the daytime. A third one crossing the street.
        The distance between the viewer and the three characters makes the viewer feel
        like they are watching the three characters from afar, almost like a voyeur.
        The composition suggests that these three people, being at the center of the
        painting, are also the <b>subject</b> of the painting.
        But is that really true?
      </p>

      <p>
        The light suggests otherwise. The way the light emphasizes the surroundings,
        rather than the characters, reveals that the <i>real</i> subject is the place
        these three characters find themselves. And the characters themselves?
        They are secondary. The scene is set at eye height for the viewer, making the
        whole ordeal feel near, inviting, enveloping the viewer <i>into</i> the scene.
        This puts the viewer in an ambiguous position.
        Where at first they might have felt like a <i>watcher</i>, they might now start
        to feel like a <i>participant</i>.
        Like they are right there, across the street, watching the three characters live
        their life. And that at any moment, the characters could spot the viewer.
        This realisation makes the relationship between the viewer and the characters suddenly unsettling, but also intriguing.
      </p>

      <p>
        <u>The painting <i>Smoking in front of Dirty Dick</i> (2026) and others from the same
        collection will be on display during <i>Les gars de Frochot</i>.
        From the 14th of February until the 21st of February 2026 at Hotel Le Pigalle. </u>

      <p>Eoghan Gilmore (b. 1997) is a photographer originally from Derry, Ireland. He holds a
        Master's degree in Film Studies from Paris, following a Bachelor's in Marketing &
        Communication from Belfast. Based in Paris, Eoghan has developed a photographic
        practice rooted in storytelling, atmosphere, and analogue experimentation.
        His work draws inspiration from a range of visual influences, notably the bold use of
        colour and contrast in the work of Belgian photographer Harry Gruyaert, and the stylistic
        coherence and cinematic quality seen in the fashion campaigns of James Harvey Kelly.
        Music, memory, and the language of film also play a central role in shaping his visual
        approach.</p>

      <p>Having worked on campaigns for De Bonne Facture, runway shows for Miu Miu , but also capturing the raw energy of touring with The Murder Capital, 
        Eoghan is not limited by a single genre. He describes his own visual language as being at the intersection of commercial and documentary.
        His personal practice continues to evolve towards more experimental uses of film —
        both still and moving image — including alternative development processes and
        darkroom printing.</p>
      <p>
      For this exhibition Eoghan developed new work, not influenced by commercial interests, but uncontaminated art, driven by the artist and his inspirations.
      </p>
      <p>
        <u>
          Eoghan's new work will be on display during Les gars de Frochot. From the 14th of February until the 21st of February 2026 at Hotel Le Pigalle.
