      <b>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</b><br><br>
      <b>Le Pigalle, Paris</b><br>
      <b>19 Jan 2026</b><br>

    <p>
      <u>Hotel Le Pigalle x Frochot Boys present: a group exhibition reflecting community in South Pigalle</u>
    </p>
    <p>Le Pigalle is pleased to present a group exhibition opening February 14th in the space of Hotel Le Pigalle: Les gars de Frochot. </p>
    <p>Central themes: Community around a physical place. Renaissance of community. . Experiencing daily life. Rue Frochot, South Pigalle, Paris.</p>
    <p>The exhibition Les gars de Frochot looks to embrace the renaissance of real community. To fight the corrosion of real life, physical, communities. Which is happening at the hands of technology giants and social media. The exhibition will be showing works of the equally named collective Frochot boys.</p>
    <p>Frochot boys is a collective born from a local community. Named after the street this community lives; rue Frochot, in the neighborhood of Pigalle, Paris. All aspects of the exhibition, including the location, designs, and artworks, are built by people who spend their daily life around rue Frochot. Working in a range of media, styles, and approaches, each artist offers their individual translation of what it is like to still have a community life based around a physical place. Walking through the exhibition submerges the viewer into this community experience, making them feel like being in Pigalle is, in a soothing way, a trusted part of their daily life. And like rue Frochot is in fact their place. Their home.</p>

      <u>Marcelino Hooi</u><br>
      Marcelino Hooi’s work uses the places and people of rue Frochot and turns their daily interactions into subject matter. Born in the Netherlands, he spends his time between Paris and Amsterdam. When not travelling to Amsterdam he is to be found living his everyday life as a neighborhood local. Reminiscent of Hopper, his works give off a sense of nostalgia. They make the viewer witness the everyday life of the people on rue Frochot, but not as a third party viewer, but right there with them.

      <u>Le Pigalle</u>
      With one of the central themes of the exhibition being community centered around a physical place, Le Pigalle serves as a reflection of the rue Frochot community. They offered to be the venue for this exhibition with the goal of continuing to be an active part of what makes this community special. “Something like this where the hotel [and cafe] are at the center of a local living community doesn't exist in a lot of places. It is a lot about the people and their connections. Having a place like this really fosters those people connections. That is something special that we have here. “
    </p>
    <p>Les gars de Frochot will be on display at hotel Le Pigalle from the 14th of February until the 21st of February.
